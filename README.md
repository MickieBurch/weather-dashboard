*Day Planner*


**Description**
Here is my weather dashboard! With this application you are able to go through and enter your local city in the city field. After you enter the city it will store on the left side for future use. You'll then be able to see the next 5 days of forecast! You are able to enter multiple city names and these will all store on the left side of the application. If you would like to clear all of these city names you are able to clear them all out with the clear button at the end of the list.
